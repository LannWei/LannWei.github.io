      "description": "I am a PhD student at the <a href=\"https://www.intelligentrobotics-acrossscales.com\" target=\"_blank\">Multi-Scale Embodied Intelligence Lab</a >, Imperial College London, supervised by <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=233I39oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate\" target=\"_blank\">Dr Dandan Zhang</a >. My current research focuses on diffusion-based sim-to-real image generation and efficient vision–language–action models to enable reliable, data-efficient robot perception and control, particularly for visuo-tactile interaction and biomedical robotics. <br><br> I received my M.E. degree in Computer Science from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2024, after I obtained my B.E. degree in Computer Science from Xiamen University in 2021."
